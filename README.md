# task-manager

Created a task manager web-app, giving users the option to login, logout, create tasks/avatars,  receive cancellation/welcome emails from the server, etc., covering CRUD operations and more with proper authentication. Integrated Node.js with MongoDB, and deployed the database on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The web app was finally deployed on heroku.
